[Verse -1]

[Chorus -1]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin'
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin' (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Verse -2]

[Chorus -2]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin'
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin' (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin' (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Outro]
Chain keep us together
Run in the shadow
Chain keep us together
Runnin' in the shadow
Chain keep us together
Runnin' in the shadow
Chain keep us together
Run in the shadow
Chain keep us together
Run in the shadow
Chain
